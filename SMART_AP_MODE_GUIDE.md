# Smart Wi-Fi AP Mode Management

This document describes the intelligent AP mode management system implemented for Björn, which provides sophisticated cycling between AP mode and connection attempts to solve the scenario where Björn fails to connect to Wi-Fi when away from home.

## Problem Scenario

**Original Issue:**
- User is not at home (away from known Wi-Fi networks)
- Björn starts and cannot connect to Wi-Fi within 1 minute
- Björn switches to AP mode and shows AP on e-paper display
- AP stays active indefinitely, draining battery and providing no value if no one connects

## Smart AP Mode Solution

### 🔄 **Intelligent Cycling Behavior**

The new system implements a sophisticated cycling pattern:

1. **Initial Connection Attempt** (60 seconds)
   - Try to connect to known networks
   - Try to connect to OS autoconnect networks

2. **AP Mode Phase** (3 minutes)
   - Start AP mode (`Bjorn` network)
   - Monitor for client connections
   - Display AP status on e-paper

3. **Reconnection Phase** (20 seconds)
   - Stop AP mode if no clients connected after 3 minutes
   - Attempt to connect to any autoconnect Wi-Fi networks stored in OS
   - Quick scan and connection attempt

4. **Cycle Repeat**
   - If no connection established, restart AP mode
   - Continue cycling until either:
     - Successfully connects to Wi-Fi network
     - User connects to AP and configures Wi-Fi

### ⚙️ **Configuration Options**

New configuration parameters in `shared.py`:

```python
"wifi_ap_timeout": 180,              # AP mode duration (3 minutes)
"wifi_ap_idle_timeout": 180,         # Timeout when no clients connected
"wifi_reconnect_interval": 20,       # Reconnection attempt duration
"wifi_ap_cycle_enabled": True,       # Enable smart cycling
"wifi_initial_connection_timeout": 60 # Initial connection timeout
```

### 📡 **AP Client Monitoring**

The system actively monitors AP usage:

- **Client Detection Methods:**
  - `hostapd_cli` status checking
  - DHCP lease file monitoring  
  - ARP table analysis for AP subnet (192.168.4.x)

- **Intelligent Timeout Logic:**
  - If clients connect: Keep AP active longer
  - If no clients: Stop after idle timeout
  - Maximum timeout: 6 minutes (safety limit)

### 🔍 **Autoconnect Network Detection**

The system can discover and use OS-level autoconnect networks:

- **NetworkManager Integration:**
  - Scans for networks marked as "autoconnect"
  - Attempts connection to available autoconnect networks
  - Uses `nmcli` for reliable connection management

- **Smart Reconnection:**
  - Prioritizes previously connected networks
  - Falls back to any available autoconnect network
  - Respects network priority settings

## 🌐 **Web Interface Integration**

### New API Endpoint

**`POST /api/wifi/ap/enable`** - Enable Smart AP Mode

```json
{
    "success": true,
    "message": "Smart AP mode enabled with 3-minute cycling",
    "ap_config": {
        "ssid": "Bjorn",
        "timeout": 180,
        "cycling": true
    }
}
```

### User Interface Features

The web interface now includes:
- **"Enable AP Mode"** button for manual activation
- **Smart cycling status** display  
- **AP timeout countdown** when active
- **Client connection** status monitoring

## 🔋 **Power Management Benefits**

### Battery Life Optimization

1. **Reduced Active Time:**
   - AP only active 3 minutes per cycle
   - 20-second reconnection attempts
   - Overall ~15% duty cycle vs 100% continuous AP

2. **Smart Sleep Patterns:**
   - Longer sleep periods when no activity
   - Reduced radio transmission time
   - Lower power consumption during reconnection attempts

3. **Activity-Based Decisions:**
   - Stops AP if no clients connect
   - Extends AP time only when needed
   - Automatic power-down of unused services

## 🎯 **Operational Scenarios**

### Scenario 1: Away From Home (No Known Networks)
```
[Start] → [60s Connection Attempt] → [FAIL] 
    ↓
[3min AP Mode] → [No Clients] → [20s Reconnection]

## 🛠️ **Implementation Details**

### Core Methods

1. **`start_ap_mode_with_timeout()`**
   - Starts AP with automatic timeout tracking
   - Enables cycling mode
   - Sets start time for timeout calculations

2. **`check_ap_clients()`**
   - Multi-method client detection
   - Updates client count and connection status
   - Used for intelligent timeout decisions

3. **`should_stop_idle_ap()`**
   - Evaluates AP stop conditions
   - Considers idle timeout and client activity
   - Implements safety maximum timeout

4. **`get_autoconnect_networks()`**
   - Discovers OS autoconnect networks
   - Filters for available networks
   - Returns prioritized connection list

5. **`try_autoconnect_networks()`**
   - Attempts connection to discovered networks
   - Uses NetworkManager for reliable connections
   - Validates successful connections

6. **`enable_ap_mode_from_web()`**
   - Web interface trigger for smart AP mode
   - Disconnects current connections if needed
   - Starts cycling behavior

### State Management

The system tracks multiple states:
- `cycling_mode`: Whether smart cycling is active
- `ap_mode_start_time`: When AP was started
- `last_ap_stop_time`: When AP was last stopped  
- `ap_clients_connected`: Whether clients are connected
- `ap_clients_count`: Number of connected clients
- `last_connection_attempt`: Last reconnection attempt time

### Smart Timing Logic

```python
# AP timeout with client consideration
if not self.ap_clients_connected and ap_running_time > self.ap_idle_timeout:
    # Stop AP if idle for 3 minutes
    
if ap_running_time > self.ap_timeout * 2:
    # Safety timeout at 6 minutes maximum
    
# Reconnection interval
if time_since_ap_stop >= self.reconnect_interval:
    # Restart AP after 20 seconds of reconnection attempts
```

## 📊 **Monitoring and Logging**

### Enhanced Logging

The system provides detailed logging for troubleshooting:

```
[INFO] AP idle timeout reached (180s) with no clients
[INFO] Stopping AP mode - switching to reconnection attempt  
[INFO] Found 2 autoconnect networks: ['PublicWiFi', 'CoffeeShop']
[INFO] Attempting to connect to autoconnect network: PublicWiFi
[INFO] Reconnection timeout reached - restarting AP mode
[INFO] Smart AP mode enabled with 3-minute cycling
```

### Status Tracking

Real-time status information available:
- Current operation mode (AP/Connecting/Connected)
- Time remaining in current phase
- Client connection count
- Cycling status and history
- Power consumption estimates

## 🔧 **Configuration Tuning**

### Recommended Settings

**Battery-Optimized (Default):**
```python
"wifi_ap_timeout": 180,           # 3 minutes AP
"wifi_reconnect_interval": 20,    # 20 seconds reconnect
"wifi_ap_cycle_enabled": True     # Smart cycling on
```

**Quick-Connect Optimized:**
```python
"wifi_ap_timeout": 120,           # 2 minutes AP  
"wifi_reconnect_interval": 30,    # 30 seconds reconnect
"wifi_initial_connection_timeout": 30  # Faster initial timeout
```

**Extended-Range Optimized:**
```python
"wifi_ap_timeout": 300,           # 5 minutes AP
"wifi_reconnect_interval": 45,    # 45 seconds reconnect  
"wifi_initial_connection_timeout": 120  # Longer initial timeout
```

## 🚀 **Usage Examples**

### Manual AP Mode Activation (Web Interface)

```javascript
// Enable smart AP mode from web interface
fetch('/api/wifi/ap/enable', {
    method: 'POST',
    headers: {'Content-Type': 'application/json'}
})
.then(response => response.json())
.then(data => {
    console.log('AP Mode:', data.message);
    console.log('Config:', data.ap_config);
});
```

### Programmatic Configuration

```python
# Configure smart AP mode settings
wifi_manager.ap_timeout = 240          # 4 minutes
wifi_manager.reconnect_interval = 25   # 25 seconds
wifi_manager.ap_cycle_enabled = True   # Enable cycling

# Start smart AP mode
wifi_manager.enable_ap_mode_from_web()
```

## 📋 **Troubleshooting**

### Common Issues

1. **AP Won't Start**
   - Check hostapd/dnsmasq installation
   - Verify wlan0 interface availability
   - Check for conflicting network managers

2. **Cycling Not Working**
   - Verify `wifi_ap_cycle_enabled` is True
   - Check timing configuration values
   - Review monitoring loop logs

3. **Autoconnect Networks Not Found**
   - Ensure NetworkManager is active
   - Check `nmcli connection show` output
   - Verify autoconnect settings in OS

### Log Analysis

Key log patterns to monitor:
- `"Smart AP mode enabled"` - Cycling started
- `"AP idle timeout reached"` - Normal cycle transition
- `"Successfully connected to autoconnect network"` - Success
- `"Reconnection timeout reached"` - Cycle restart
